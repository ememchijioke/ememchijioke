Hi, I'm Emem Chijioke  

I'm currently studying for an MSc in Artificial Intelligence(AI) & Cybersecurity and an M.Eng. in Information and Communication Engineering  at the [University of Klagenfurt (AAU)](https://www.aau.at).  
My current focus is on automation-driven engineering, with an interest in building systems that remain reliable, understandable, and maintainable beyond experimentation.

Through coursework and projects, I have worked on multi-UAV coordination, applied reinforcement learning, and Python-based automation, alongside foundational exposure to cloud and security engineering. I am particularly interested in autonomous and distributed systems, where coordination, monitoring, and structured workflows play an important role.
Current Research   
- Multi-UAV coordination using MAPPO with GRU-based agents  
- Reinforcement learning for distributed control
