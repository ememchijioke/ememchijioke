Hi, I'm Emem Chijioke  

I'm currently studying for an MSc in Artificial Intelligence(AI) & Cybersecurity and an M.Eng. in Information and Communication Engineering  at the [University of Klagenfurt (AAU)](https://www.aau.at).  
Through coursework and project work, I have been developing a strong interest in automation-driven engineering and how intelligent systems can be designed to remain reliable and maintainable in practice.

My academic and hands-on projects include work on multi-UAV coordination, applied reinforcement learning, and Python-based automation, as well as foundational topics in cloud and security engineering. I enjoy working on problems that involve system behavior, experimentation, and integration, rather than isolated algorithms.

I am particularly interested in autonomous and distributed systems, especially where aspects such as coordination, monitoring, and failure handling become important. In my work, I aim to keep systems understandable and reproducible by relying on structured workflows, configuration-driven setups, and clear documentation.

Alongside my studies, I continue to build practical projects to strengthen my understanding of automation, security-aware design, and applied machine learning.
Current Research   
- Multi-UAV coordination using MAPPO with GRU-based agents  
- Reinforcement learning for distributed control
